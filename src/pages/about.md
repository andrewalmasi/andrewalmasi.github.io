<p>I'm a lot of things.<br>
And those things change pretty often.<br>
But currently I'm a Computer Science major with a passion in finding new technology and figuring out how to use it.<br>
I'm also a reader, interested in discovering the best way to life secularly as well as passionately with love.<br>
Last but not least, in the words of Coach Bennett, I'm a runner.
